# TechTrack
TechTrack develops a platform for monitoring and managing technical equipment such as industrial robots, manufacturing equipment, quality control systems, etc. However, at the moment the company has a problem with managing data on the technical condition of equipment.
## Assignment:

Your task is to develop a RESTful API based on the provided specification to manage a list of users. The API should allow users to be created, read, updated, and deleted. Provide basic authentication and authorization for API access. The service must be able to process simultaneous requests from multiple clients and ensure high data availability.

## Additional requirements:

The API specification should be well documented using tools such as Swagger or OpenAPI.

Provide support for standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for each resource.

Implement error handling and return appropriate HTTP statuses and messages.

Possible questions and answers:

Question: How will you ensure the security of your API?

Answer: We can use Access Tokens to authenticate users and restrict access based on roles and permissions.



Question: What measures will you take to ensure the performance of your API?

Answer: We can use data caching and database query optimization to improve performance. In addition, we can scale the application horizontally to handle large volumes of requests.

Question: How will you test your API?

Ans: We can write unit tests using tools like unittest for Python to test the core functionality of the API. In addition, we can conduct integration testing to check how the API interacts with other system components.

Question: What data formats will you use to pass information through the API?

Ans: We can use JSON format to exchange data between client and server as it is easy to read and supported by many programming languages.

Question: How will you ensure data consistency across parallel queries?

Ans: We can use transaction mechanisms in a database to ensure data integrity during create, update and delete operations.

### Database details:
## Tables:

Equipment: Contains information about each device, including unique ID, equipment type, model, installation date, status, etc.

Data: Stores equipment status indicators such as temperature, speed, pressure and other parameters. Each entry is associated with a specific equipment and contains a timestamp and parameter values.

Alerts: Contains information about events that require operator attention, such as warnings about possible failures or abnormal situations. Each alert is associated with a specific piece of equipment and contains a description of the event and a timestamp.

# Relations:

The Data and Alerts tables are linked to the Equipment table via a foreign key to provide tracking of data and alerts for specific equipment.

Additional relationships can be added to ensure data integrity and query optimization.
